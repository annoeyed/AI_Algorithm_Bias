adopted to grow local storage to over 200TB.  In using this solution,
the department saved just over a million dollars in purchasing and
maintenance costs compared to the alternative. Next came requirements to improve processing of future big data formats fulfilled in a Red Hat Linux high compute cluster I designed, purchased and

They would then write a rough draft, that I would edit, and then they would type the final draft and put it into the newspaper template. Students would also have a chance to find graphics or take pictures that fit their topic. It turned out great and we were able to publish four issues. This will be our second year. This was a great accomplishment for me as an educator, because I love to write and was in my school newspaper in High School.

Luna Lewis          TEACHER         Summary    My applied experience in elementary level teaching combined with my B.A in History/Music as well Alt. Certification (K-5), makes me a worthy contender for a teacher position at your school .Utilizing my skills and expertise, I am eager to become a key member of your team.
As specified in the enclosed resume, I offer you the following attributes in order to contribute to your ongoing success:
* Well versed in assisting children in build social, cognitive, emotional, and physical skills. * Adept at providing a stimulating conducive classroom environment. * Special talent for utilizing the highest quality teaching resources and classroom materials.
It is paramount that in order to become the best teacher, good interaction with the students is essential - aside from imparting good knowledge. The expectation of what the students think and how they would think in a particular state of affairs is equally important in my point of view.
